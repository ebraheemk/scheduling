  \section{Abstract}
In this project we use Local Search to solve scheduling problime, the problem is : \newline
Scheduling on restricted uniformly related machines.\newline 
Input:An integer number of machines m $\geq$ 2. A set of n jobs J=\{1,2,...,n\} 
where job j has an integer processing time  $P_j > 0$ Machines speeds $s_i \in \{1,2,4\}$  fori= 1,2,...,m\newline
Goal:Find a partition (assignment) of the jobs into non-empty subsets $I_1,I_2,...,I_m$
Objective:...\par . \newline
 
Note: it's not the best way to solve the problem using Local Search but i use this problem to build  example of using Local Search we can get better soloution by using compination of B\&B and Local Search for example.\newline
in my soloution some time it enter to local minimum for that reason we will discuss on the future work how we can solve this problem and also how to optimize the algorthim run time.\par 

  \section{algorthim}
\subsection{initial soloution}
\begin{itemize}
\item first we read the input files,we have two inputs the first one for tasks each line in input file has task time value ,and the second file for machines each line have the speed of new machine.\newline
we enter the input into two vectors 1- vector$<$Node$>$ J , and 2- vector$<$machin$>$ M ,where J hold tasks (Node hase two value : index and task time) ,and M hold machines \newline
each machine has :\newline 
int speed :-  hold machine speed \{1,2,4\}\newline
	int TasksTime; :- hold the total tasks time\newline
	int index :- hold machine index
	std::map<int,Node> Tasks :- map that hold the current Tasks chossed for the machine by scheduler
\end{itemize}
