We have three folders BandB/Genetic/LocalSearch on each folder we have project (we have three different projects) each project we should compile and run separately to compile the project you must download cmake

To download and install cmake :[https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)

After that we should build the project on each folder we have another folder with name build there we want to build the project

For example if we want to build LocalSearch we set the LocalSearch location as source and choose the build folder as the build see the picture:

2-you should write two input files

First file with name **tasks.txt** that have on each line integer number represents task time

Second file with name **machines.txt** that have on each line integer number represents machine speed (1,2,4)

**Output :**

You can find the output result on output folders

On each project you can find folder with examples
