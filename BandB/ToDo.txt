*we calculate lower bound wrong its not tasktime+(remind tasks time / machines speed time) becuze tasktime is the worst machine time and 
we can enter another tasks to other machines thate have time less than taskstime

*to solve memory problem we can hold array of vectors where each vector hold the tasks for machine k and once we call all the node son we
can remove it
