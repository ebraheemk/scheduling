*we calculate lower bound wrong its not tasktime+(remind tasks time / machines speed time) becuze tasktime is the worst machine time and 
we can enter another tasks to other machines thate have time less than taskstime

*to solve memory problem we can hold array of vectors where each vector hold the tasks for machine k and once we call all the node son we
can remove it

*build the search as bfs so we can remove each time the last level nodes

in bfs we have save leafs evrey time and we have many if we go in dfs is best and we only save the best path

*IF WE reach the optimal should stop

* if we have two machins with the same taskstime and speed and new task we should call recursive only one of them
